  The wrist braces Casey wears help make typing more comfortable and prevent Repetitive Strain Injury. 
  They probably aren't made anymore, but they're the Medi-Active ones without the thumb brace.

  kind of game it will be yet, but we know it will be 2D, cross-platform, and feature art by Yangtian Li 
  as well as specially licensed music. For more information, visit http://handmadehero.org/

   We are currently using software rendering in order to implement our own renderer. Ultimately

   max out performance.
